# About

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/martinlindhe/dustbox-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/martinlindhe/dustbox-rs)

a x86 16-bit emulator with the goal of running old MS-DOS games.

This is a project I use to learn rust and improve my understanding of low level stuff.
In the current state, it runs a few simple demos and is not very impressive.
If you are looking for a more complete dos emulator, I suggest you check out [dosbox-x](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x).
